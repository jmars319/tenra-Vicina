# Vicina

Vicina by JAMARQ is an experimental hyperlocal coordination app for seeing
what is happening nearby right now. Its tagline is "What's happening nearby."
The product is intentionally not a traditional feed, follower, or popularity
platform.

## Repo Layout

- `apps/webapp`: Next.js App Router web MVP scaffold and primary product surface.
- `apps/desktopapp`: Vite + React + Tauri desktop shell.
- `apps/mobileapp`: Expo React Native MVP scaffold with Expo Router.
- `packages/*`: Shared Vicina packages for domain logic, contracts, validation, realtime, auth, geo, privacy, UI, and config.
- `assets/branding/`: Archived design-reference assets.
- `supabase/`: SQL migration and seed data for the Supabase MVP backend.
- `scripts/`: Root lifecycle commands for bootstrap, development, verification, and environment checks.
- `docs/`: Short operational docs for developers working inside the scaffold.
- `archive/version-minus-1/`: Archived Version -1 prototype material preserved outside the new canonical layout.

## Install

Use Node 22 or newer.

```bash
pnpm install
```

Useful commands:

```bash
pnpm dev:mobile
pnpm dev:web
pnpm dev:start
pnpm dev:status
pnpm dev:verify
pnpm dev:stop
pnpm verify:web
pnpm verify:mobile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm doctor
```

## Dev Harness

`pnpm dev:web` remains the direct interactive Next.js dev command. For repeatable
start/stop/status flows, use the managed harness:

```bash
pnpm dev:start
pnpm dev:status
pnpm dev:restart
pnpm dev:stop
pnpm dev:verify
```

The managed harness starts only the web app because Vicina does not currently
have a separate local backend server. It writes PID files and logs under `.dev/`,
checks `/api/health`, smoke-tests the core web routes, and stops its own process
cleanly.

Local overrides are optional:

```bash
mkdir -p .dev
cp scripts/dev-config.example.sh .dev/dev-config.sh
```

Edit `.dev/dev-config.sh` to change the managed web port, host, health path, or
timeouts. The default managed port is `3002` so it can coexist with other local
projects that commonly use `3000`.

## Web MVP

The primary web surface uses Next.js App Router with a small design system under
`apps/webapp/src/components`:

- `branding`: SVG Vicina mark, wordmark, and lockup based on the reference image
- `layout`: shared app header and page shell
- `ui`: Button, Card, Chip, Input, and Textarea primitives
- `signal`: reusable signal cards and filter controls

Routes:

- `/`: landing/hero with full Vicina lockup
- `/nearby`: active signals with distance, category, time, and explicit sort controls
- `/create`: lightweight signal creation form with Zod validation
- `/profile`: display name, bio, and local user's active signals
- `/signal/[id]`: signal detail, interest button, thread, report, and block actions

The web MVP uses browser-local mock data from
`apps/webapp/src/lib/mock/signals.ts` so it can run before Supabase is wired into
the web app. It intentionally avoids follower counts, likes, popularity ranking,
and infinite-scroll mechanics.

Run it with:

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

## Mobile MVP

The mobile scaffold uses:

- Expo React Native with TypeScript and Expo Router
- Supabase auth, Postgres, realtime-ready tables, storage-ready project setup, and RLS
- Zod validation through `@vicina/validation`
- TanStack Query for server state
- Seed fallback data so the nearby feed and detail routes render before Supabase is configured

Routes:

- `/auth`
- `/(tabs)/nearby`
- `/(tabs)/create`
- `/(tabs)/profile`
- `/signal/[id]`
- `/settings`

## Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project at `supabase.com`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
3. Paste your project values:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY
```

4. Install and authenticate the Supabase CLI if needed.
5. Link the project and run migrations:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
supabase db push
```

For local Supabase:

```bash
supabase start
supabase db reset
```

`supabase/seed.sql` creates local seed users and active signals for development.
The mobile app also has a TypeScript seed fallback in
`apps/mobileapp/src/data/seedSignals.ts` so the feed renders without a backend.

## Database Schema

The MVP migration lives at
`supabase/migrations/20260502120000_vicina_mvp.sql` and creates:

- `profiles`
- `signals`
- `signal_interests`
- `signal_comments`
- `user_blocks`
- `reports`

The schema includes UUID primary keys, `created_at` and `updated_at`, safe
defaults, indexes for active signal lookup and latitude/longitude bounding-box
queries, and RLS policies for authenticated ownership. Anonymous users can read
visible, active, unexpired signals. Authenticated users can create and manage
only their own signals, interests, comments, reports, and blocks.

## Run Expo

```bash
pnpm dev:mobile
```

The app launches with seed data if Supabase env vars are absent. Live posting,
replying, reporting, and blocking require Supabase auth.

## MVP Limitations

- Nearby search is intentionally geospatial-ish: latitude/longitude indexes plus
  app-side radius filtering. PostGIS can replace this when the product needs it.
- Display names are minimal and profile editing is not fully built.
- Realtime subscriptions and storage upload flows are not wired yet, though the
  Supabase stack and schema leave room for them.
- Moderation is foundational only: report, block, and content status fields.

## Safety And Privacy

- Vicina never displays exact coordinates publicly.
- The mobile app rounds coordinates before sending them.
- Public UI uses approximate labels such as "near Downtown" or "within 2 miles."
- No likes, follower counts, popularity ranking, or infinite-scroll engagement
  mechanics are included.
- Comments/replies live only inside a signal thread.

## Smoke Checklist

- Web root renders the full brand lockup.
- Web header renders icon + `Vicina` without the tagline.
- Web `/nearby`, `/create`, `/profile`, and `/signal/[id]` routes render.
- Web create signal form validates required fields and 24-hour max expiration.
- Auth screen renders at `/auth`.
- Nearby tab renders seeded active signals.
- Radius controls support 1, 3, 5, and 10 miles.
- Create signal form rejects missing title/description and expiration over 24 hours.
- Signal detail renders approximate area, time, expiration, interest count, and thread.
- Profile tab renders signed-out and signed-in states.
- No exact latitude/longitude is displayed in public UI.
- `pnpm verify:mobile` passes.

## Notes

- The archived Version -1 app remains separate from the new scaffold so the repo reads as Vicina rather than as a nested historical artifact.
- Shared workspace imports are wired into all three app shells.
- The current web MVP lives in `apps/webapp` and runs against local Next.js API routes with a gitignored dev store. See `docs/WEB_MVP.md`.
