# Suite Handoff Registry

Generated from the suite handoff contract inventory by `scripts/generate-handoff-registry.mjs`.

This repository participates in tenra-suite local handoffs. Handoffs are explicit JSON payloads moved through local UI actions, API routes, exports, imports, or fixtures. Apps should not read another app's private storage directly.

Envelope baseline:

- `schema`: exact contract id when the payload has one.
- `sourceApp`: producing app when the contract supports it.
- `exportId`: stable producer export id when duplicate-safe reconciliation is needed.
- `exportedAt` or `exportedAtMs`: creation timestamp.
- `traceId` or source artifact metadata when a downstream app needs audit context.
- Target apps are advisory routing metadata, not hidden coupling.
